// drive.mjs — the bits needed to actually *play* a first-person three.js game
// from a script, extracted so play-games.mjs and capture-previews.mjs share one
// implementation instead of two drifting copies. Castle Conundrum took a copy
// of this file with it on 2026-09-15 (#491); the two are forks now.
//
// Everything here assumes a headed browser (`launch({ headed: true })`). A hidden
// or headless page doesn't composite, so requestAnimationFrame never fires, the
// render loop never runs, and every function below waits forever instead of
// failing usefully. See README.md.

/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ probing */

// None of these games expose their scene or camera globally, and
// `renderer.render` is an OWN property on the instance in three (r160 and r169
// both: `this.render = function (scene, camera)`), so patching
// `WebGLRenderer.prototype.render` captures nothing.
//
// What does work is patching `Object3D.prototype.updateMatrixWorld`. Both handles
// fall out of that single hook, because `WebGLRenderer.render()` calls it on the
// scene every frame AND on the camera every frame (`if (camera.parent === null)
// camera.updateMatrixWorld()`, and these games all keep their camera out of the
// scene graph). So one patch, both objects, no traversal and no guessing.
//
// `getWorldDirection` is also hooked, but only as a nicety — it fires first in
// games that raycast forward for interaction, so the camera is captured a frame
// or two earlier there. Don't rely on it alone: Golden Hour and Aphelion never
// call it, and an earlier version of this file that only had these two hooks plus
// a `PerspectiveCamera.updateProjectionMatrix` fallback hung on both of them —
// updateProjectionMatrix runs at construction (before this patch is installed)
// and then only on resize.
//
// `threeUrl` must be the *same specifier the game's import map resolves to*, or
// the module registry hands back a second copy of three with its own prototypes
// and the patch lands on nothing.

 * Camera x/z, eye height, yaw and pitch.
 *
 * `yaw` is raw `rotation.y`, kept because a controller's own unwrapped yaw field
 * drifts by whole turns over a long session and a beat sometimes wants to see
 * that. Do not steer by it.
 *
 * `facing` and `pitch` come off the camera's world matrix instead, and that is
 * not a stylistic choice. Every hand-rolled controller here writes
 * `camera.quaternion` from its own `Euler(pitch, yaw, 0, 'YXZ')`, while
 * `camera.rotation` decomposes that quaternion back in three's default XYZ
 * order — and the two disagree. At yaw ±π, XYZ has no way to say "turned all
 * the way round" with its y term, so it says it with x and z instead: a camera
 * looking down +z reports `rotation.y === 0.000` and `rotation.x === ±3.142`.
 * Verified against the vendored three-0.160.0 directly.
 *
 * That is a 180° lie about heading and a 180° lie about pitch, both at the one
 * heading a walk aft is made of, and it is silent: `walkTo(..., steer:'lookAt')`
 * reads `facing` back as 0, turns another half-turn to "correct" it, and
 * oscillates until it runs out of bursts. `lookAt` then reads `pitch` as ±π and
 * cranks the camera into the ceiling trying to level it. Aphelion's airlock is
 * at the aft end of the hab, so its beat walks straight into this.
 *
 * The third column of `matrixWorld` is the camera's local +Z in world space;
 * negate it for the way the camera looks. That is order-free and exact
 * everywhere, gimbal-degenerate headings included. No `THREE` import needed, so
 * this does not depend on `attachSceneProbe` having stashed `window.__THREE`.
